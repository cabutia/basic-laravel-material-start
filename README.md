# Getting started

## Requirements
There's a few dependencies you need to download before cloning the repository.
  * [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Cloning the project
First, open a `Terminal`, then enter:
`git clone https://github.com/lgabrielgomez/basic-laravel-material-start`.
This will create a directory called `basic-laravel-material-start`. Inside, you'll find the repository

## Configuring
The repository comes along with all the required files for using MaterializeCSS Framework.
Once cloned, you must `cd` into the created repository, then, install all dependencies via **Composer** running `composer install`.
This will create a `vendor` folder, containing everything you need.
